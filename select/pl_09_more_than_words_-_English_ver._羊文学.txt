I think about the words he said
To me, it over again
Were they the words I wanted?
All of me
I wonder 'round and 'round again
Lately I've been tired,
I'm never myself
Just giving into
every expectation
Holding in my words,
they won't never know
How I really feel hidden
in my mind
But when you say
that it all doesn't matter
There's something there still
in you
That's trying to love yourself
I know that you see it too
And know that there's
always more to the story
So when the depths
take hold of you
There'll be a hand to
pull you through
Just be by your side
Ha-ha, ha-ha, yeah
And give you more than words
Give you more than words
Oh-oh ah-oh, eh-yeah ayy
I take the letter to the screen
Then start it over again
Indecision's got me overwhelmed
I can't, I can't make up my mind
There's so much
that I need to know
About the world that I don't
I could pretend
to be a know-it-all
Then hurt from what
I'm made to say
It's been a while since
I've found myself
Avoiding risks and
all anticipation
Letting go of what,
what I really want
There was something there,
but is it gone now?
It slips away from me,
and now I'm used to being
Stuck in this pool of sadness,
disappointment
Feelin' like a fool,
but there's more to do
It's not over yet,
it's still too early to know
'Cause when it feels like
there's nothing you can do
There's something
there still in you
That's wanting to
believe that you,
you can do it too
If you can't make out
the edges of your pain
And in the night, you falter
I'll be there,
I have been there too
Just be by your side
Ha-ha, ha-ha, yeah
And give you more than words
Give you more than words
Get it now, get it now, yeah
Get it now, get it now
No conceding now from here on,
I will take the wheel
Give it all I've got,
I get it now, get it now
Where there's a tunnel there's
a way out
Do you see the light?
And you are there for me
Go on, get along
It's how you'll know how to
make it right
There's no quitting now,
I get it now, get it now
Let go of the math
You know in your heart
what you want
Here goes now,
we can get our freedom
More than ever now
you know that this,
this is what it takes
Every second count in this life,
live only once
Here's your cue to hit the stage
Our music's here to stay
Let me,
let me show you how it could be
Give you more than words
