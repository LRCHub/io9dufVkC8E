I think about the words
he said to me, over again
Were they the words
I wanted out of me?
I wonder round and round again
Lately I've been tired,
and I've found myself
Just giving in
to every expectation
Holding in my words,
they won't need to know
How I really feel,
hidden in my mind
But when you say
that it all doesn't matter
There's something there,
still in you
That's trying to love yourself,
I know that you see it too
And know that
there's always more to the story
So when the depths,
they call to you
There'll be a hand
to pull you through
just be by your side
and give you more than words
give you more than words
I take the letter to the screen,
then start it over again
Indecision's got me overwhelmed
I can't, I can't make up my mind
There's so much
that I need to know
about the world that I don't
I could pretend
to be a know-it-all,
then hurt from
what I'm made to say
It's been a while,
since I found myself
Avoiding risks
and all anticipation
Letting go of what,
what I really want
There was something there,
but is it gone now?
It slips away from me,
and now I'm used to being
Stuck in this pool of sadness,
disappointment
Feeling like a fool,
but there's more to do
It's not over yet,
it's still too early to know
"Cause when it feels like
there's nothing you can do
There's something there,
still in you
That's wanting to believe
that you,
You can do it too
If you can make out
the edges of your pain
And in the night, you falter
I'll be there,
I have been there too
just be by your side
and give you more than words
give you more than words
(I get it now)
No conceding now from here on,
I will take the wheel
Give it all I've got
(I get it now)
Where there's a tunnel
there's a way out,
do you see the light
And you are there for me
Go and get it wrong,
it's how you'll know
how to make it right
There's no quitting now
(I get it now)
Let go of the math you know
in your heart what you want
Here goes,
now we can head to freedom
More than ever now you know
that this, this is what it takes
Any second now,
here's a life, live only once
Here's your cue
to hit the stage,
the music's here to stay
Let me, let me show you
how it could be
give you more than words
